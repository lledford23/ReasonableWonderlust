Developed a full-stack application that supports a user through the planning process of budgeting, packing and keeping track of vacations. The User can create an account, update their credentials and/or delete their account. The application has the following features: create a vacation and budget, a to-do list for that specific vacation, edit vacation information and to-do list.
